# Assignment 3

## Added polymorphic behavior to the chair assignment from Assignment 1. Now, there is a parent class, called Furniture, that has attributes of different pieces of furniture. I added a BeanBag and Couch class that extends the Furniture class, and used methods from the Furniture class.

## The Python version is under the ```python``` folder; the C++ version is under the ```c++``` folder.
